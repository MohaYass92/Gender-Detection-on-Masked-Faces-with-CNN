# Gender-Detection-on-Masked-Faces-with-CNN
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for gender classification based on facial images of individuals wearing masks. The model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras and achieves high accuracy in identifying gender even when facial features are partially obscured by a mask.
